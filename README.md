# Well Log Lithofacies Analysis Using PCA and DBSCAN Clustering

This project utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and DBSCAN clustering to analyze well log data and identify distinct lithofacies trends.

## Dataset

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contains the following columns:

* **Depth (ft):** Measured depth of the well (in feet).
* **GR (API):** Gamma Ray (American Petroleum Institute units).
* **ILD_log10 (log10(ohm-m)):** Base-10 logarithm of deep induction resistivity.
* **DeltaPHI (v/v):** Difference between neutron porosity and density porosity.
* **PHIND (v/v):** Neutron porosity.
* **PE (b/e):** Photoelectric effect.
* **NM_M (v/v):** Normalized M parameter.
* **RELPOS:** Relative position.
* **RHOB (g/cmÂ³):** Bulk density.
* **PHID (v/v):** Density porosity.
* **NM_P (v/v):** Normalized P parameter.
* **RILD (ohm-m):** Deep induction resistivity.
* **SP (mV):** Spontaneous potential.

**Note:** For this analysis, we primarily focused on the well log features (GR, RHOB, RILD, SP) for lithofacies interpretation.


## Methodology

## Methodology

1.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * [Describe any data cleaning or preprocessing steps]

2.  **K-means Clustering (Initial Exploration):**
    * As an initial step, K-means clustering was performed to explore potential groupings within the data.
    * **Elbow Method:** The elbow method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters (k). The plot of within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters showed an "elbow" at k = [Optimal k value], suggesting this as a suitable number of clusters.
    * **Silhouette Method:** The silhouette score was calculated for different values of k to validate the optimal k value. The highest silhouette score was observed at k = [Optimal k value], further supporting the choice of this number of clusters.
    * [Optional: Include images of the elbow and silhouette plots if you have them.]

3.  **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
    * PCA was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the well log data and identify the principal components that explain the most variance.
    * The first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) were used for visualization and clustering.

4.  **DBSCAN Clustering (Final Clustering):**
    * DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) was used to identify clusters of similar well log measurements in the PCA space.
    * The `epsilon` and `min_samples` parameters were tuned to achieve meaningful clusters.
    * Noise points (outliers) were identified and labeled as -1.

5.  **Crossplot Analysis:**
    * Crossplots were generated to visualize the relationships between different well log measurements and how they relate to the identified DBSCAN clusters.
    * The following crossplots were created:
        * GR vs. RHOB
        * RHOB vs. RILD
        * GR vs. SP
        * RILD vs. SP
    * **Note:** The crossplot images are generated within the code and displayed using `matplotlib.pyplot.show()`.

| 8 | 79.28 | 2.25 | 10.00 | -78.91 | Dense shale | High RHOB |
| 9 | 350.92 | 2.32 | 21.12 | -87.76 | Very dense radioactive shale | Extreme GR |
| 10 | 247.96 | 2.45 | 20.26 | -84.52 | Very dense radioactive shale | Extreme GR |

### Lithofacies Interpretations

* **Shale:** Clusters with high GR, low RHOB, and low SP likely represent shale lithofacies (e.g., Cluster 1, 8, 9, 10).
* **Carbonate:** Clusters with low GR and high RHOB likely represent carbonate lithofacies (e.g., Cluster 7).
* **Sandstone:** Clusters with low GR and low RHOB likely represent sandstone lithofacies (e.g., Cluster 5).
* **Tight Formations/Hydrocarbons:** Clusters with high RILD likely represent tight formations or hydrocarbon-bearing zones (e.g., Cluster 5, 4).
* **Transitional Lithofacies:** Overlapping clusters likely represent transitional lithofacies or interbedded layers (e.g., Cluster 0).
* **Cluster 6:** This cluster exhibits extreme values, suggesting a very dense, potentially radioactive shale, possibly a metallic shale.
* **Clusters 2, 3, and 4:** These clusters display inconsistencies that require further investigation.

## Limitations

* This analysis is based on four well logs and lacks geological context and core data.
* The DBSCAN clustering algorithm is sensitive to parameter selection.
* The interpretation of Clusters 2, 3, and 4 remains uncertain.

## Future Work

* Obtain geological information about the formation.
* Integrate core data (descriptions, photos, analysis).
* Incorporate additional well logs (neutron porosity, sonic logs).
* Perform petrophysical analysis (mineralogical analysis, fluid saturation modeling).
* Explore other clustering algorithms.
